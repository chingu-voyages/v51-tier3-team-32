# Funsplit

An expenses splitting app

Users can create groups and enter details of expenses shared by the group.  The user can allocate a proportional share of the expenses to each member of the group.  The user can then use the check boxes on the app to tick off when each user has paid off the amount they owe for their share of the total expense.

  We lost 3 team members along the way so some team members did not have the opportunity to add themselves to this page

  ## Technologies used
  Our team used vite for this app.
  Heroku was used to deploy the backend of the app.
  Vercel was used to deploy the frontend of the app.

  ## Future Improvements

  We still have lots left to do!  A list of these things is below.
  - Users should be able to send reminders to those in their group to remind them of the portion of the expense they still have to pay.
  - Users should be able to delete groups
  - Users should be able to edit groups
  - Users should be able to see a dashboard showing expenses for all groups they have set up.
